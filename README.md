# Consensus Countdown

A multiplayer community mini-game built on **GenLayer**.

Players vote YES / NO on a subjective question.
An AI proposes an outcome.
Validators finalize the result using **Optimistic Democracy**.

This project demonstrates:
- Intelligent Contracts
- Non-deterministic AI decisions
- Equivalence-based consensus
- On-chain XP tracking

Frontend: Next.js  
Backend: GenLayer Intelligent Contract  
Deployment: Vercel (planned)
